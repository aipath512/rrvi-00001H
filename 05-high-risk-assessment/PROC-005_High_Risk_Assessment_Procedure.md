# 1. PURPOSE

This procedure defines the standardized process for determining whether an Artificial Intelligence system qualifies as a **High-Risk AI System** under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act).

The objective is to ensure consistent, repeatable, and auditable classification decisions.

---

# 2. SCOPE

This procedure applies to:

- All AI systems developed or used by the organization  
- All third-party AI systems integrated into internal workflows  
- All procurement, deployment, or modification of AI systems  
- All business units and operational environments  

---

# 3. INPUT REQUIREMENTS

The following inputs are required before classification:

- AI System Inventory Record  
- Intended Purpose Description  
- Technical Documentation (if available)  
- Vendor/Supplier Information  
- Use Case Description  
- Deployment Context  
- Relevant regulatory references (Annex I / Annex III)

---

# 4. PROCEDURE OVERVIEW

The classification process follows a deterministic step-by-step assessment:

---

## STEP 1 — AI SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION

Assign a unique identifier from the AI Inventory.

Output:

- AI_System_ID
- System Name
- Owner

---

## STEP 2 — INTENDED PURPOSE ANALYSIS

Document the intended use of the AI system.

Include:

- functional purpose  
- operational environment  
- affected stakeholders  
- decision-making role (if any)

Output:

- Intended Purpose Statement

---

## STEP 3 — DEPLOYER / PROVIDER ROLE IDENTIFICATION

Determine organizational role:

- Provider  
- Deployer  
- Importer  
- Distributor  
- Product Manufacturer (if applicable)

Output:

- Role Classification

---

## STEP 4 — ANNEX I SCREENING

Check whether the AI system is subject to Annex I regulated product integration.

Output:

- Annex I relevance: YES / NO  
- Justification

---

## STEP 5 — ANNEX III SCREENING

Evaluate whether the AI system falls under Annex III high-risk categories, including but not limited to:

- biometric identification  
- employment-related decision systems  
- education and training systems  
- access to essential services  
- law enforcement-related systems  
- migration, asylum, border control systems  
- justice and democratic processes

Output:

- Annex III relevance: YES / NO  
- Category mapping (if applicable)

---

## STEP 6 — EXCLUSION CHECK

Verify whether the system qualifies for exclusion or exception under applicable regulation.

Output:

- Exclusion status  
- Legal justification

---

## STEP 7 — RISK CLASSIFICATION DECISION

Based on previous steps, classify the system:

- HIGH RISK  
- NOT HIGH RISK  
- REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW

Decision must be justified.

---

## STEP 8 — DOCUMENTATION OF EVIDENCE

All supporting evidence must be recorded in the compliance system:

- assessment forms  
- system documentation  
- vendor declarations  
- screenshots / logs (if applicable)  
- internal review notes  

---

## STEP 9 — COMPLIANCE REVIEW

The Compliance Officer shall:

- validate assessment completeness  
- confirm classification decision  
- ensure evidence adequacy  
- approve or reject classification  

---

## STEP 10 — REGISTRATION & ARCHIVING

Final results must be stored in:

- High-Risk Assessment Register  
- AI System Inventory  
- Compliance Evidence Repository  

---

# 5. OUTPUT ARTIFACTS

This procedure produces:

- High-Risk Classification Record  
- Assessment Checklist  
- Compliance Declaration  
- Evidence Package  
- Audit-Ready Register Entry  

---

# 6. REVIEW & UPDATE

This procedure must be:

- reviewed annually  
- updated upon EU AI Act amendments  
- revised when new Annex III interpretations are issued  
- audited during compliance cycles  

---

# 7. NON-COMPLIANCE

Failure to follow this procedure may result in:

- invalid risk classification  
- regulatory exposure
