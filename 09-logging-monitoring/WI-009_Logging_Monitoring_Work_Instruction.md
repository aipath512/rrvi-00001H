- logging requirements have been defined;
- monitoring responsibilities have been assigned.

---

# 3. Required Information

Collect the following information:

- AI System ID
- AI System Name
- AI System Owner
- Logging Location
- Monitoring Tool
- Event Types
- Retention Period
- Review Frequency
- Responsible Reviewer

Store evidence in:

EVID-009_Logging_Monitoring_Evidence.md

Examples include:

- log extracts;
- monitoring dashboards;
- system alerts;
- screenshots;
- incident reports;
- audit reports.

---

## Step 7

Periodic Review.
